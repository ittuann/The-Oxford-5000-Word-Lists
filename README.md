## Notes

- The TXT files may not contain exactly 3000 or 5000 entries because duplicate words were removed.

For example, the PDF may list `bear (deal with) v.` and `B2 bear (animal) n. A2`, while in the TXT version they are merged into `bear`.

- The knowledge of the 3000 most frequent English word families or the 5000 most frequent words provides 95% vocabulary coverage of spoken discourse. ([Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary#Foreign-language_vocabulary))
